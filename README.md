# Welcome to Keras Deep Learning on Graphs (Keras-DGL)

The aim of this keras extension is to provide Sequential and Functional API for performing deep learning tasks on graphs. Specifically, Keras-DGL provides implementation for these particular type of layers, 

* Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GraphCNN).
* Graph Attention Convolutional Neural Networks (GraphAttentionCNN).
